# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineerince is the science /art of using programing skills to solve realworld issues by building relevant software .The technology industry relies on software engineering whereby engineers entrepret hunam immaginations to real solutions

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.mastering of machines-this was a period before compilers were discovered codding strongly relied on direct hardware optimizations
2.the a.i era - the era where computers started performing tasks previously presumed to be performed by humans
3.the internet(www) & communications age - this was the age were scientists had discovored digital ways of communication e.g websites

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.planning -here gaps are identified ,solutions proposed,and implimentation goals set
2.The analysis stage -here project team is assemled,requirements assesed and putting tongethor adesign proposal
3.The design stage - here real coding of the project happens by first producing a prototype and if approved software is developed and tested
4. Implimentation stage - purchase of nessesary equipment,publisizing  roll out,user training .
5. the use stage - making use of system,audits and proposal for reengineering.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology is a rigid model in which once requirements are collected changes are not allowed in later stages Unlike agile methodology where changes can be introduced anywhere in the developemnt phase

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer -is responsible for designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software
Quality assurance -ensures that software meets stsndards befoe deployment and keeps continous improvemnets in check
Project manage -oversees the planning,complition and excecution

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
